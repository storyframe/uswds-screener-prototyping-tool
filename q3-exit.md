# You may still be able to file a complaint.

We typically only accept complaints that are filed within 6 months of when a complaintant knew or could have known the alleged violation occurred.

If you would like to proceed with filing a complaint about an incident that occurred more than 6 months ago, we strongly suggest including as much evidence and detailed information as possible to increase the chances your claim will be processed.
