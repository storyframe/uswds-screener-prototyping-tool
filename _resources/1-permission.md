As long as you do not object, your health care provider is allowed to share or discuss your health information with your family, friends, or others involved in your care or payment for your care.

For example:

- An emergency room doctor may discuss your treatment in front of your friend when you ask that your friend come into the treatment room.
- Your hospital may discuss your bill with your daughter who is with you at the hospital and has questions about the charges.
- Your doctor may talk to your sister who is driving you home from the hospital about your keeping your foot raised during the ride home.
- Your doctor may discuss the drugs you need to take with your health aide who has come with you to your appointment.
