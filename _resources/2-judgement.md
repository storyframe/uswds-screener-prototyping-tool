If you are not around or cannot give permission, your health care provider may share or discuss your health information with family, friends, or others involved in your care or payment for your care if he or she believes, in his or her professional judgment, that it is in your best interest.

For example:

- A surgeon who did emergency surgery on you may tell your spouse about your condition, either in person or by phone, while you are unconscious.
- A pharmacist may give your prescription to a friend you send to pick it up.
- A doctor may discuss your drugs with your caregiver who calls your doctor with a question about the right dosage.
