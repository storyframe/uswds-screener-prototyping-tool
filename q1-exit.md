# We may not be able to complete your request.

We can only help with complaints that involve a [covered entity](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html){: .usa-link}{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under [HIPAA laws](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html){: .usa-link}{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. *You can still try to file if you want, but it may be rejected if it doesn't involve a covered entity.*

## Try these resources for other situations.
